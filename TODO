- tests for consistent die return strings

- XS code.  Really we want to either a speedup of vec routines,

CODES:

- m > 2 Fibonacci codes

- Omega ~0

- Ternary Comma

- Fenwick punctured codes

- Goldbach and Ulam additive codes.  Probably not efficient
  for anything large.

- Thoughts on Huffman, arithmetic

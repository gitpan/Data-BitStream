- documentation for text methods (add_code, code_get, code_put, ...)

- tests for invalid behavior
- tests for consistent die return strings

- Export

- XS code.  Really we want to either a speedup of vec routines,
  basically like Scalar::Vec::Util to add big-endian help, or
  go all out and write something that makes a SV string with all
  our methods supported.

- Would be nice to do Moo/Mouse/Moose interchangably.  Any::Mouse, basically.
  mst says he's moving Moo toward a Mouse replacement, but at the moment there
  are a lot of changes to the module source between the two.  See:

- text code needs some redoing

- tie to a file to avoid holding everything in memory.
  Either File::Map or PerlIO :mmap or Sys::Mmap

CODES:

- m > 2 Fibonacci codes

- Omega ~0

- Ternary Comma

- Fenwick punctured codes

- Goldbach and Ulam additive codes.  Probably not efficient
  for anything large.

- Thoughts on Huffman, arithmetic

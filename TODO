- documentation for text methods (add_code, code_get, code_put, ...)

- tests for invalid behavior
- tests for consistent die return strings
  - read unary off end of stream
  - put negative numbers should give "value must be >= 0" for all put_*
  - write with undefined value
  - put_* with undefined parameters or undef value
  - get_* with undefined parameters
  - put_string with invalid string (e.g. '0012')

- tie to a file to avoid holding everything in memory.
  Either File::Map or PerlIO :mmap or Sys::Mmap

CODES:

- m > 2 Fibonacci codes

- Omega ~0

- Ternary Comma

- Fenwick punctured codes

- Goldbach and Ulam additive codes.  Probably not efficient
  for anything large.

- Thoughts on Huffman, arithmetic
